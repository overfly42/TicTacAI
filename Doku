3.b.II) 27 Inputs
3.c) Full Supervised AI
4) Statistics
5) Training of AI
6) Storage and Reload functions of trained AI and Statistics (for continues Training)
=Design=
The Design should handle the different requirements. For this the requirements have to split the software into sepate modules:
1) The Game with the game logic and an entry point for player types
1.1) There should be a view to the game board and statistics
1.2) The Rules should be managed by the game
1.3) For the Training there should be a possibility to start a number of sequential games
1.4) every participant of a game should get the information in the same way (you/free/opponent)
2) The Player should be connected via an interface to the game
2.1) The implementation of the player should offer all possibilities to use this interface (GPU Access vor KI / GUI for Human)
2.2) The Interface Implementation should not be connected to the game other than the interface
2.3) It shouldn't matter witch symbol is assigned to an implementation
